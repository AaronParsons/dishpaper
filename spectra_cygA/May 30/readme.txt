Taken on the dish 14'10"

with PAPER balun, receiver, one port out from receiver is fed into spectrum ana
lyzer

Since there is only one input port on the spectrum analyzer, I took separate measurements of the two polarizaiton. If anything I didn't specific in this textfile regarding the settings on each .csv, they are in the header of the csv files.


first polarization:
trace336.csv: attenuation of 0dB, freq range 100-200MHz, avg: 100 measurements, bandwidth: 1MHz, sweep time: 4ms
trace339.csv: attenuation of 0dB, freq range 100-200MHz, avg: 16 measurements, bandwidth: 1MHz, sweep time: 4ms
trace340.csv: attenuation  of 0dB, freq range 50-250MHz, avg: 100 measurements, bandwidth: 1MHz, sweep time: 4ms

another polarization:
trace344.csv: attenuation of 0dB, freq range 100-200MHz, avg: 100 measurements, bandwidth: 1MHz, sweep time: 4ms
trace343.csv: attenuation of 0dB, freq range 50-250MHz, avg: 100 measurements, bandwidth: 1MHz, sweep time: 4ms

\section{Design and Construction}
\label{sec:design}

\subsection{bent pipes as approximation to parabola}
The construction method is based on the use of a reasonably stiff spar supported at a few points as a low-pass spatial filter.  Additionally, a moment-loaded beam naturally attains a parabolic shape, depending on the loading, the moment of intertia and the material's Young's modulus (see {\em e.g.} http://ruina.tam.cornell.edu/ Courses/~ME4730/ Rand4770 Vibrations/ BeamFormulas.pdf).  In this instance we fix the angle at the rim ($r_e$) of 7m and at a hub radius ($r_h$) of about 45 cm, so between those two points, the effective angle is $(r_e-r_h)/(2F)$, where $F$ is the focal length (4.5m).  Equating that angle to the angle of the cantilevered beam (using scenario 5 of the web-site) we find
\begin{equation}
y = \left(\frac{r_e-r_h}{L}\right)\frac{x^2}{4F}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the length of the beam.
Assuming, $(r_e-r_h) \approx L$ (in this case, the ratio is 0.91) we find we have the equation for our desired parabola.  Note that we do not contend that this figure over the entire length of the actual beam achieves this, but merely that if properly held and loaded it tends to the right shape.

In our construction, we hold the spar at three locations at the proper location and angle and then rely on the fairly stiff spar to "filter" out any higher frequency ripples and on the physics to give us the overall general shape.

\end{figure}

\subsection{faceting}
The construction of the surface stretches mesh panels over adjacent spars, so the surface is not a true paraboloid but rather a faceted parabola, although note that the construction does pull down the mesh mid-panel to both better approximate a paraboloid as well as to hold the mesh.

If we assume an actual faceted parabola ({\em i.e.} the mesh if perfectly flat between adjacent spars) we can calculate the rms deviation from a paraboloid for various spar configurations.  For this antenna, we chose 12 spars out to 1.45m, then transitioning to 24 spars.  Choosing just 12 spars all the way out to the rim yields an rms of 6.9cm (corresponding to a Ruze loss of almost 18\% at 150 MHz), as opposed to 1.7cm (for about 1 \% loss).

\subsection{shielding}
The panels across the dish surface are made out of 6 different dimensions of galvanized wire cloth $\frac{1}{4}$"; employing different dimensions at different heights to reduce the surface bumps produced during installation.

\subsection{splash cone}
\begin{figure}[H]

This cone structure is used in the cone test, a slight modification may be applied for better backlobes reduction as suggested by the reflection measurements in the cone test. 
\label{Fig:splashcone} }

\end{figure}
\clearpage

\subsection{hub}
The central hub has an overall diameter of 37", the inner sono tube has an interior diamater of 18", the outer sono tube has an interior diameter of 36". The launch angle of the spar sleeves is $+2.86^{\circ}$ from the inner sono tube to the outer sono tube, the supporting sleeves (botton sleeves) do not have any launch angles.


\subsection {feed suspension}
The feed suspesnsion mechanism consists of a back plane made out of wire cloth and $\frac{3}{4}$" schedule 40 white PVCs bolted on a metal hexagon, and a mast from the metal structure connects the dipole feed to the back screen. The whole feed structure is suspended above the hub by attaching kevlar wires from the three poles to the back of the metal structure. 

Each pole has a reel with kelvar ropes wrapped, adjustments to feed height can be made by cranking the reels.


\subsection{material, PVC selection}
The dish structure is made out of schedule 40, white PVCs to minimize the bending effect under sunlight exposure; PVCs are subject to thermal contraction and expansion with a linear thermal coefficient of $50.4\times10^{-6}\ \frac{m}{m^{\circ}C}$.

\section{Time Domain Reflectometry}
\label{sec:reflect}
With the use of a vector network analyzer (VNA), time domain reflectometry is a
technique that measures the magnitude and phase of a reflected signal, often 
referred to as S-parameter as function of time and frequency. The return loss 
of the reflection is dependent on the impedance of the device under test (DUT). The 
network analyzer provides a frequency swept signal and the inverse Fourier 
transform is then performed to produce reflection parameter measurements as a 
function of time.

S-parameter stands for "scattering parameters", the term is widely used to describe a device 
under test at any distance in network measurements provided that the transmission cable used 
is lossless, the magnitude remains constant when propagating down the cable. $S_{ii}$ is 
analogue to optical reflection coefficient, and $S_{ij}$ is analogue to optical transmission 
coefficient.

In a two port network that was used in the dish test, the incident wave ($a_1$, 
$a_2$) are independent variables, and the reflected waves ($b_1$, $b_2$) are 
the dependent variables used to define the S-paramters. $a_i$ and $b_i$ of the $i^{th}$ port is 
related to the temrinal voltage $V_i$, the terminal current $I_i$ and a reference impedance 
$Z_0$ as follows:

\begin{align}
a_i &= \frac{V_i+Z_iI_i}{2\sqrt{|{Re Z_i}|}}  \\
b_i &= \frac{V_i+Z_i^{*}I_i}{2\sqrt{|{Re Z_i}|}}
\label{Eqn:ab}
\end{align}
\noindent and in terms of $V_{inc-i}$ voltage incident on and $V_{ref-i}$ voltage reflected from port $i$ as follows:
\begin{align}
a_i &= \frac{V_{inc-i}}{\sqrt{Z_0}} \\
b_i &= \frac{V_{ref-i}}{\sqrt{Z_0}}.
\end{align}

The relationship between the reflected and incident power at each port of a network can be described linearly as:
\begin{align}
b_1 &= S_{11}a_1 + S_{12}a_2 \\
b_2 &= S_{21}a_1 + S_{22}a_2
\end{align}
and in matrix representation: 
\begin{align}
\left( \begin{array}{c} b_1 \\ b_2\end{array}\right) = 
\begin{pmatrix} S_{11} & S_{12} \\ S_{21} & S_{22} \end{pmatrix} \times
\left( \begin{array}{c} a_1 \\ a_2\end{array}\right)
\end{align}

When considering the incident power at port 1, the power can either be reflected on the same port as $b_1$ or be transmitted through port 2 as $b_2$. When the output port (port 2) is terminated with a matched load, $S_{11}$ becomes:
\begin{align}
S_{11} &= \frac{b_1}{a_1}|_{a_{2}=0} \nonumber \\
& = \frac{  \frac{V_1}{I_1}-Z_0 }  {\frac{V_1}{I_1}+Z_0   } \nonumber \\
& = \frac{Z_1-Z_0}{Z_1+Z_0} \nonumber \\
S_{21} &= \frac{b_2}{a_1}|_{a_{2}=0} 
\end{align}

$S_{11}$, $S_{22}$ are the input and output reflection coefficient 
respectively, hence they are a measure of the input and output mismatch loss. $
|S_{11}|^2$ is the ratio of the reflected power from versus the
incident power on the input port, $|S_{22}|^2$ is the ratio of that of the 
output port. $S_{21}$ measures the forward transmission a.k.a the voltage gain 
and $S_{12}$ measures the reverse transmission a.k.a the voltage gain. The 
square of $S_{21}$ is the ratio of power delivered to a load with impedance $Z_0
$ versus power avaialble from source with $Z_0$.  Hence $S_{12}$ and $S_{21}$ 
are a measure of the insertion gain.

TDR measurements are often related to the reflection coefficient $\Gamma$ [-1, 1] and the 
voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), by definition:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{V_{reflected}}{V_{incident}} 
\end{equation}

\begin{align}
VSWR & = \frac{E_{max}}{E_{min}} \nonumber \\
&	 = \frac{1+\Gamma}{1-\Gamma}
\end{align}
where $E_{max}$ and $E_{min}$ are in reference to the envelop of the travelling 
wave.

When the VNA measures the S-parameters in the frequency domain, the data is 
measured across a pre-defined frequency range and stored at discrete points 
across this span. The frequency spacing between data points is proportional to 
the frequency span and inversely proportional to the total number of data points
.

Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is carried out with the feed as the device 
under test after the mesh panels are installed. In this application, time 
domain reflectometry measures the reflections on the dish as a function of time 
as a result of impedance mistmatch between the feed electronics and the sky 
signal. The characteristic impedance of the output signal from the vector network analyzer and transmission coaxial cable is $50\Omega$. The impedance in free space is $120\pi\Omega$, with the use of a 4:1 passive balun at each polarization, the signal through the balun at the reference plane should have a characteristic impedance of $30\pi\Omega$. In practice, a third impedance in the system comes from the PAPER feed element itself and is simulated as $\sim130\Omega$. In effect, the test has two devices under test in the network.

Each polarization is connected to a port on the vector network analyzer, the time axis represent the physical distance as the signals propagate along the transmission cables. The physical distance of can be related to the time axis using:
\begin{equation}
D = \frac{t}{2}v_{fac}c,
\end{equation}

$t$ is the round trip travel time as recorded as the time data.
The VNA is calibrated at the end of the cables connecting the baluns, hence the 
velocity factor in the measurements can be taken as $1$, resulting the speed of 
propagation to be the speed of light $c$, thereby $1$ ns is equivalent to $29.98$ cm in free space and approximately $1$ ft from the passive baluns.

The expected reflection from simulation and mathematical derivation is -$60$dB by $2$ reflections between the focal point and the vertex. The designed focal length of the dish is $4.5$m, $2$ times of reflection (i.e. $4$ crossings attenuation) corresponds to $59.0$ ns in time domain.

\subsection{Choice of Hardware}
The dual-polarization feed used in PAPER is implemented in this prototype, consisted of four sleeved dipoles, the crossed dipoles made from copper tubing are encased between two thin alminium disks(A. Parsons, 2008). A 4:1 passive balun is attached to the dipole through a mating board for each polarization, fixed-length $50\Omega$ coaxial cables connect the baluns to the ports of a VNA for TDR measurements. The LMR400 coaxial cables of length 10 m has a signal attenuation of $\sim$0.5 dB over 10 m at 150 MHz. The Aglient ES8753A is being used as the VNA to carry out the TDR measurements, the system dynamic range is 100 dB at 16 MHz to 3 GHz and the directivity is 55 dB at 300 kHz - 1.3 GHz, where the frequency range of interest is 50 MHz - 1 GHz. 

\subsection{Calibration of VNA}
Calibration is performed prior to taking measurements to eliminate the systematic effects caused by cables, adapters, and connectors. Performing calibration at the end of the cables shifts the reference plane to the SMA connectors of the cables that are connecting the baluns with zero phase, zero loss and zero mistmatch; as such, the measurements taken are showing only the effects of the feed and baluns under different configurations. The full two port calibration is done by attaching the calibration standards (SHORT, OPEN, LOAD, and THROUGH) to the end of the $50\Omega$ cables, the VNA calculates the correction coefficients and applies the coefficients subsequently to each measurements. The calibration coefficients includes offset delay, capacitance in the form of a fourth order polynomial, inductance as a fourth order polynomial, offset loss as resistance per second, and offset characteristic impedance. 

The effect and significance of such calibration is shown in Figure \ref{Fig:calibration}. The blue 
curve shows that without calibration, systematic errors 
cause the response function to vary over frequencies when the end of the cables 
is opened, the red curve shows that with calibration, the 
measurements are what one would expect. In theory, $S_{ii}$ of the $i^{th}$ should be $0$ dB and independent of frequency; zero return loss measured in dB corresponds to $\Gamma$ being $1$, no power was being transmitted, which is measured in the caibrated red curve. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width =\textwidth]{./reflectometry_plots/Calibration_open}
	\caption{The reflection and tramission parameters of the full 2-ports are plotted as a function of frequency to show the significance of applying standard calibrations prior to taking measurements. The blue curves represent the uncalibrated results, and the red curves represent the calibrated results when the far cable ends were not terminated. The calibrated result shows a constant $0$ dB over frequency as predicted.}
\label{Fig:calibration} 
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

A SHORT standard calculates the offset delay, offset loss, and specifies the inductance coefficients $L_0$ through $L_3$ to model the phase shift caused by the residual inductance in the standard as a function of frequency by fitting a forth order polynomial. An OPEN standard calculates offset delay, offset loss, and specifies the capacitance coefficients $C_{0}$ through $C_{3}$ to model the phase shift due to fringing capacitance as a function of frequency by fitting a forth order polynomial. The offset delay is the one way propagation time that can be obtained from speed of light in free space, the physical length and the permittivity constant of the cable material; the offset loss as a function of frequency is caused by the skin effect of offset coaxial type standards. During the calibration process, the SHORT standard and OPEN standard are off by $180^\circ$; the reflection coefficients should be $1$ (0 dB) at $0^\circ$, and $1$ at $180^\circ$ at all frequencies for OPEN standard and an ideal zero-length short respectively. A perfect LOAD standard should have a reflection coefficient of $0$ as the characteristic impedance $Z_0$ matches the specfied impedance on the network analyzer. 

\subsection{Configurations}
The measurements are taken with 401 data samples between 50 MHz to 1 GHz, giving a time resolution of 1.05 ns; each set of data is averaged by 16 measurements for higher SNR. The first test being carried out is by varying the feed height above the vertex, and the second test is by placing a splash cone on the central hub centered on the vertex of the parabolic dish. The feed height test was carried out at three different heights above the dish: $67"$, $10'3.5"$, and $14'0.5"$ to verify the effect of reflection as a function of time delay which is directly related to the travelled distance of a signal and the number of crossings attenuation. The cone test was carried at a distance $14' 6"$ above the vertex to investigate the backlobes of the antenna and the effectiveness of reducing the backlobes by placing the splash cone structure as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:splashcone}.

\subsection{Window Functions}
To deal with real-life situations of a finite bandwidth which results in 
spectral leakage in time domain, a window function is applied to the frequency domain data 
prior to performing the inverse Fourier 
transform in order to increase the dynamic range of the measurements and minimize the effect of leakage in time 
domain by reducing the sidelobe levels; the disadvantage however, is the 
widening of the pulse width between data points hence reducing the time 
resolution. 

As shown in Figure \ref{Fig:windowwidth}, the spectra features are 
emphasized by multiplying a window function to the frequency response prior to 
performing the inverse Fourier transform to time domain. By varying the $\beta$ value of a 
Kaiser-Bessel window or by choosing different window functions, such as the Blackman-Harris 
window (cyan) give different side-lobe levels, as shown in the time range 200 - 300 ns. The  
default window function used in the TDR 
analysis throughout this document is the Blackman-Harris. The 
strong reflection peaks to the left of 
40 ns is caused by impedance 
mismatch along the signal path in the connectors, the mating board, and more 
importantly, from the impedance of the feed itself.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Delay Spectrum for Configurations}
 The time axis shows the delay in nanoseconds as the signal propagates starting 
 from the calibrated reference plane: the SMA connectors at the far ends of the cables. When the 
signal first contact the conectors on the balun, the mating board, and the feed, the signal is not 
masked by reflections caused by any components between the connectors and the reference 
plane, as demonstrated by the strong reflection peaks between $0$ ns - $30$ ns. When the signal continues to propagate after the first reflection, the power is reduced from the 
original pulse as the first impedance mismatch caused some of the power to be reflected back
as opposite to being fully transmitted.  

All the traces in Figure \ref{Fig:moutain} show that there are two large peaks representing the reflections from the moutains nearby, the black curve in the figure was measured while the feed was resting at $\sim$60 ft from the dish, and those two peaks shifted in time accordingly.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width =.7\textwidth]{./reflectometry_plots/Mar28/s11all-mar28mix17set1}
	\caption{$S_{11}$ of the height test, performed while the feed was hanging at height : 67", 
10'3.5", and 14'0.5" above the vertex. The black curve represents the S11 measurement as the 
feed was located at $\sim$60 ft from the dish, hence the peaks at $\sim$260 ns and 
$\sim$330 ns implies that they are the reflections due to surrounding moutains.
\label{Fig:moutain} }
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

Intuitively, the peaks associated with the connectors and surrounding environment should be 
unshifted in time as the feed height varies, as these components were static during the 
measurements. Figure \ref{Fig:height_test} shows the time domain response when the feed is 
positioned at 67", 10'3.5", and 14'0.5" above the vertex, raised by 4' from the preceeding, 
$4.5$ m is the focal length of the 14 m parabolic dish with $\frac{f}{D} = 0.32$. By $59$ ns, as 
required in the antenna design, the $S_{11}$ is down by -$61.7$ dB excluding the reflection 
peak caused by the mountains as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:moutain}.

lastly the blue curve, taken at height 14'0.5" (the ideal focal distance of the parabolic dish). By 
$59$ ns, as required in the antenna design, the $S_{11}$ is down by over -$61.7$ dB excluding 
the reflection peaks caused by the mountains.

\subsection{Cone test}
VNA measures the time responses of when the cone is placed on the central hub 
versus when the cone was absence as the feed was at height 14'6" in both setups. The 
measurements in Figure \ref{Fig:conetest} show that the placement of the splash cone reduces 
the backlobes in the response up to $\sim48$ ns, at which the power is down by -$55$ dB.

$59$ ns, the response is down by -$59.9$ dB.

\subsection{RFI investigation}
To measure the spectra of the sky with the prototype, the dipole element is connected to the PAPER active balun which has a total amplification of $\sim 32$ dB for the signals from both polarizations and outputs analog signals through fixed-length RG-6 $75\Omega$ coaxial cables into the PAPER receiver. The receiver contains two 100-200MHz bandwidth filters, and outputs $50\Omega$ signals after amplification with gain $\sim$ XX dB. The $50\Omega$ signals travel along the LMR 400 cables to the Agilent E4407B spectrum analyzer. The spectra are taken with 401 data points, ranging from $100$ - $200$ MHz, and 50 measurements are averaged to improve the SNR, the resolution bandwidth is specified to be 1 MHz with 0 dB attenuation, and the resulting spectra has a resolution of 0.25 MHz.

Cygnus A, a radio bright source is at right accension $19h59m28s$ and declination $+40^\circ44'02"$ and the dish is located at $+37.98^\circ$ latitude, and $-122.19^\circ$ longitude. Cygnus A, hence is an ideal source for the sky test as it transits at night time during the summer when observations are carried out. Three spectra shown in Figure \ref{Fig:RFI} are taken at different times in a day: daytime, before and during the transit of Cygnus A in our beam during the nighttime.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width =.8\textwidth]{spectra_plots/transit,day,night_match-yaxis.png}
	\caption{Three spectra taken at different times in a day spanning the frequency range from 100 MHz to 200 MHz. Radio stations and TV broadband channels are the major RFIs in the vicinity of our dish. During nighttime, as shown by the blue and red curves, the beam pattern can be studied by observing the power of a radio bright source throughout the night in those narrow channels with minimal RFIs.
\label{Fig:RFI}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

Spectra in Figure \ref{Fig:narrowchannels} are taken at nighttime, approximately 4 hours before Cygnus A transits within the beam to ensure uncontaiminated frequency channels can be effiectively identified. As the resolution bandwidth is reduced from 1 MHz to 1 kHz and the averaging number of measurements is reduced to 0, channels with minimal RFIs are identified as 120 - 130 MHz, 155 - 160MHz, 165 - 175MHz and color plotted as green, red, and cyan respectively in Figure \ref{Fig:narrowchannels}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width =.8\textwidth]{spectra_plots/all_channels}
	\caption{The narrow channels with minimal RFIs are identified as 120 - 130 MHz, 155 - 160 MHz, and 165 - 175 MHz. The power in dBm are lower than the spectra shown in Figure \ref{Fig:RFI} as the resolution bandwidth is reduced from 1 MHz to 1 kHz.
\label{Fig:narrowchannels} }
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\clearpage

Spectra are taken in those frequency channels every $10\pm2$ minutes throughout a night as Cygnus A rises and transits across the beam. Figure \ref{Fig:120130allnight}, and \ref{Fig:165175allnight} show that within these narrow channels that were identified according to the 100-200MHz spectra, RFIs were present occassionaly throughout the observing night; hence, narrower channels within the spectra are extracted to calculate the power as a function of altitude and local sidereal time.

\subsection{How well did we place everything}
stringent parameters that affect the overall parabolic dish surface error, geometry of rays, 
-the hub is centered at the vertex within couple inches....

Resurvery the center for hub after telephone poles were stabilized in the ground. The telephone poles have varying diamater and along the length. 

The surrounding posts are not equidistant to the center of the hub; within ~5' between maximum post to center distance and minimum post to center distance.

The survey points in the table is defined as:
Pole 1 = the very first pivot pole, hand drilled hole; 
Pole 2 = The highest pole near the fence; 
Pole 3 = the pole closes to the shed, near where our cars are parked


\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline

Point 1 & Point 2 & Distance \\ \hline
Pole 1 & Pole 2 & 48'$\frac{1}{4}$'' \\ \hline
Pole 1 & Center & 332'' \\ \hline
Pole 1 & Pole 3 & 47'$\frac{2}{3}$'' \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{The table lists the distances between poles and center before drilling the 2 holes after locating 
the point of same horion using a theodolite and 2X4s \label{Tab:survey_dist_b4_2holes}.}
\end{table}



We measured the pole to pole distance after the center is finalized at the same height on all poles.

\begin{table}[!h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline

Point 1 & Point 2 & Distance [Feet] \\ \hline
Pole 1 & Pole 2 & 47.1 \\ \hline
Pole 2 & Pole 3 & 47.4 \\ \hline
Pole 1 & Pole 3 & 46.9 \\ \hline

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\begin{itemize}
\item relevance to HERA, project cost
\item link Pober et al. (2014) sensitivity/science
\item polarization matching
\item frequency coverage, need for a feed re-design.
\end{itemize}
